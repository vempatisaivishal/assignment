1. **Architecture Overview**

The library management system follows a modular design pattern, with each module responsible for managing a specific aspect of the system. The main components are:

- `models.py`: Defines the data models (`Book`, `User`, and `Checkout`) used throughout the system.
- `book.py`: Handles book-related operations, such as adding, listing, updating, deleting, searching, and checking availability of books.
- `user.py`: Manages user-related operations, such as adding, listing, updating, deleting, and searching users. It also enforces unique user IDs and names.
- `check.py`: Responsible for checking out and checking in books for users. It prevents checkout of unavailable books and enforces user-specific check-in operations.
- `storage.py`: Provides a simple interface for loading and saving data to JSON files.
- `logger.py`: Handles logging of various operations performed within the system.
- `main.py`: Contains the main entry point and user interface for the library management system.

2. **module: models.py**

This module defines the data models used throughout the system.

```python
class Book:
    def __init__(self, title=None, author=None, isbn=None):
        """
        Initialize a Book object with its attributes.

        Args:
            title (str, optional): The title of the book.
            author (str, optional): The author of the book.
            isbn (str, optional): The ISBN (International Standard Book Number) of the book.
        """
        self.title = title
        self.author = author
        self.isbn = isbn
        self.checked_out = False  # Initialize as available by default
```

- The `Book` class represents a book in the library.
- It has attributes for `title`, `author`, `isbn`, and `checked_out` (a flag indicating whether the book is currently checked out or not).
- The constructor allows creating a `Book` instance with or without providing initial values for the attributes.

```python
class User:
    def __init__(self, name, user_id):
        """
        Initialize a User object with its attributes.

        Args:
            name (str): The name of the user.
            user_id (str): The unique ID of the user.
        """
        self.name = name
        self.user_id = user_id
```

- The `User` class represents a user of the library.
- It has attributes for `name` and `user_id`.
- The constructor requires providing values for both attributes.
- The `user.py` module enforces the uniqueness of user IDs and names when adding new users.

```python
class Checkout:
    def __init__(self, user_id, isbn):
        """
        Initialize a Checkout object with its attributes.

        Args:
            user_id (str): The ID of the user who is checking out the book.
            isbn (str): The ISBN of the book being checked out.
        """
        self.user_id = user_id
        self.isbn = isbn
```

- The `Checkout` class represents a checkout record, which associates a user with a book they have checked out.
- It has attributes for `user_id` and `isbn`.
- The constructor requires providing values for both attributes.

3. **module: book.py**

This module provides a class for managing book-related operations in the library management system.

```python
class Book:
    """
    A class for managing books in a library management system.
    """

    @staticmethod

```python
    @staticmethod
    def list_books() -> List[Dict]:
        """

        Raises:
            IOError: If there is an error loading or saving the user data.
            ValueError: If the name or user_id is not a valid string, or if the name or user_id already exists.
        """
        # ... (implementation details) ...
        # Check for duplicate user IDs and names, and raise ValueError if found

            ValueError: If the user_id or isbn is not a valid string, or if the book is not available for checkout.
        """
        # ... (implementation details) ...
        # Check if the book is available for checkout, and raise ValueError if not
```

- The `checkout_book` method creates a new `Checkout` instance with the provided `user_id` and `isbn`.
- It then appends the dictionary representation of the new checkout record to the list of existing checkouts loaded from the `checkouts.json` file.
- It also logs the operation using the `Logger` module.

- It also logs the operation using the `Logger` module.
- The method handles potential errors, such as `IOError` and `ValueError`, and raises appropriate exceptions if needed.
- It checks if the user is allowed to check in the book (i.e., if the user checked out the book initially), and raises a `ValueError` if not.

6. **module: storage.py**

This module provides a simple interface for loading and saving data to JSON files.

```python
class Storage:
    @staticmethod
    def load_data(filename):
        """
        Load data from a JSON file.

        Args:

        """
        # ... (implementation details) ...
```

- The `Storage` class provides two static methods: `load_data` and `save_data`.
- The `load_data` method loads data from a JSON file specified by `filename`.
- If the file doesn't exist or is empty, it returns an empty list.
- The `save_data` method saves the provided `data` (a list) to a JSON file specified by `filename`.

7. **module: logger.py**

This module provides a simple logger for logging operations within the library management system.

```python
class Logger:
    @staticmethod
    def log_operation(operation, details):
        """
        Log an operation with its details to a text file.

        Args:
            operation (str): The name of the operation being logged.
            details (str): Additional details or parameters related to the operation.
        """
        # ... (implementation details) ...
```

- The `Logger` class provides a single static method: `log_operation`.
- The `log_operation` method takes an `operation` (string representing the operation name) and `details` (string containing additional details about the operation).
- It appends the operation and its details to the `log.txt` file.

8. **module: main.py**

This module provides the main entry point and user interface for the library management system.

```python
class Main:
    def __init__(self):
        """
        Initialize the LibraryManagementSystem with instances of Book, User, and Check.
        """
        self.book_manager = Book()
        self.user_manager = User()
        self.check_manager = Check()

    def main_menu(self) -> str:
        """
        Display the main menu options for the LibraryManagementSystem.

        Returns:
            str: The user's selected choice.
        """
        # ... (implementation details) ...

    def run(self) -> None:
        """
        Run the main loop of the library management system application.
        """
        while True:
            try:
                choice = self.main_menu()
                if choice == "1":
                    # ... (implementation details) ...
                elif choice == "2":
                    # ... (implementation details) ...
                # ... (other choices) ...
                elif choice == "13":
                    print("Exiting.")
                    break
                else:
                    print("Invalid choice, please try again.")
            except (ValueError, IOError) as e:
                print(f"Error: {e}")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    library_system = Main()
    library_system.run()
```

- The `Main` class serves as the main entry point for the library management system application.
- It initializes instances of `Book`, `User`, and `Check` classes, which are used for managing books, users, and checkouts/checkins, respectively.
- The `main_menu` method displays a menu of options for the user to choose from.
- The `run` method runs the main loop of the application, allowing the user to select options from the menu and perform various operations.
- The `run` method also handles potential `ValueError` and `IOError` exceptions, displaying an error message to the user.
- The `__main__` block creates an instance of the `Main` class and calls its `run` method to start the application.

**Additional Features**

Preventing Duplicate User IDs and Names: We added functionality to ensure that there are no duplicate user IDs or names when adding a new user. If a duplicate is detected, the system notifies the user that the user already exists.

Book Availability Tracking: We implemented book availability tracking to prevent users from checking out books that are already checked out by another user. The system checks the availability of the book before allowing a checkout operation.

Enforcing User-specific Check-in: Only the user who has checked out a book is allowed to check it back in. Other users cannot perform the check-in operation for books that they have not checked out.
