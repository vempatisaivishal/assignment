1. **Architecture Overview**

The library management system follows a modular design pattern, with each module responsible for managing a specific aspect of the system. The main components are:

- `models.py`: Defines the data models (`Book`, `User`, and `Checkout`) used throughout the system.
- `book.py`: Handles book-related operations, such as adding, listing, updating, deleting, and searching books.
- `user.py`: Manages user-related operations, such as adding, listing, updating, deleting, and searching users.
- `check.py`: Responsible for checking out and checking in books for users.
- `storage.py`: Provides a simple interface for loading and saving data to JSON files.
- `logger.py`: Handles logging of various operations performed within the system.
- `main.py`: Contains the main entry point and user interface for the library management system.

2. **module: models.py**

This module defines the data models used throughout the system.

```python
class Book:
    def __init__(self, title=None, author=None, isbn=None):
        """
        Initialize a Book object with its attributes.

        Args:
            title (str, optional): The title of the book.
            author (str, optional): The author of the book.
            isbn (str, optional): The ISBN (International Standard Book Number) of the book.
        """
        self.title = title
        self.author = author
        self.isbn = isbn
        self.checked_out = False  # Initialize as available by default
```

- The `Book` class represents a book in the library.
- It has attributes for `title`, `author`, `isbn`, and `checked_out` (a flag indicating whether the book is currently checked out or not).
- The constructor allows creating a `Book` instance with or without providing initial values for the attributes.

```python
class User:
    def __init__(self, name, user_id):
        """
        Initialize a User object with its attributes.

        Args:
            name (str): The name of the user.
            user_id (str): The unique ID of the user.
        """
        self.name = name
        self.user_id = user_id
```

- The `User` class represents a user of the library.
- It has attributes for `name` and `user_id`.
- The constructor requires providing values for both attributes.

```python
class Checkout:
    def __init__(self, user_id, isbn):
        """
        Initialize a Checkout object with its attributes.

        Args:
            user_id (str): The ID of the user who is checking out the book.
            isbn (str): The ISBN of the book being checked out.
        """
        self.user_id = user_id
        self.isbn = isbn
```

- The `Checkout` class represents a checkout record, which associates a user with a book they have checked out.
- It has attributes for `user_id` and `isbn`.
- The constructor requires providing values for both attributes.

3. **module: book.py**

        self.check_manager = Check()

    def main_menu(self) -> str:
        """
        Display the main menu options for the LibraryManagementSystem.

        Returns:
            str: The user's selected choice.

                else:
                    print("Invalid choice, please try again.")
            except (ValueError, IOError) as e:
                print(f"Error: {e}")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    library_system = Main()
    library_system.run()
```

- The `Main` class serves as the main entry point for the library management system application.
- It initializes instances of `Book`, `User`, and `Check` classes, which are used for managing books, users, and checkouts/checkins, respectively.
- The `main_menu` method displays a menu of options for the user to choose from.
- The `run` method runs the main loop of the application, allowing the user to select options from the menu and perform various operations.
- The `run` method also handles potential `ValueError` and `IOError` exceptions, displaying an error message to the user.
- The `__main__` block creates an instance of the `Main` class and calls its `run` method to start the application.
